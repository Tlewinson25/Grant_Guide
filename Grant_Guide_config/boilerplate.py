CONTRACT = """# Reviewing Checklist

This draft was created by a generative artificial intelligence (AI).

We hope that its assistance saved you time. However, it is only intended as a rough draft.

***NOTE*** The NIH has [expressed concern](https://grants.nih.gov/faqs#/use-of-generative-ai-in-peer-review.htm?anchor=56922) that generative AI increases the likelihood of academic misconduct. The checklist below is meant to help you address these concerns.
